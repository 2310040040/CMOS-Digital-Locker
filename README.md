# 🔐 CMOS Digital Locker

This repository contains the design and implementation of a CMOS-based Digital Locker using Cadence Virtuoso. The project focuses on transistor-level CMOS design of digital logic blocks and their integration into a secure digital locking system.

## 📌 Project Description

The CMOS Digital Locker is designed using fundamental CMOS logic circuits such as an inverter, NAND gate, XOR gate, D flip-flop, and a 2-bit counter. All circuits are created and verified at the schematic level in Cadence Virtuoso.
